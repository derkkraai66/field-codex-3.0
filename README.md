## Overview

Field Codex 3.0 is an open-source meta-framework that treats **physics, ecology, AI, cognition and complex systems** in one unified language: **fields**.

A field is formally defined as:

\[
\Phi:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{T}\rightarrow\mathcal{S}
\]

where  
- **𝒳** = domain (space, graph, agents, topology)  
- **𝒯** = time  
- **𝒮** = state space (ℝⁿ, embeddings, probability distributions)

The Codex introduces:

- **Coherence (C)** — order, alignment, structure  
- **Interference (I)** — constructive/destructive interaction  
- **Mutability (M)** — plasticity under perturbation  
- **Field Renormalization Group (FRG)** — coherence across scales  
- **Field Causal Calculus (FCC)** — interventions and cause–effect  
- **Coherence Thermodynamics** — energy/entropy limits  
- **Field Computational Hierarchy** — complexity of field operations  
- **Adaptive Field Topology** — self-modifying geometry  
- **Explicit AI Mapping** — transformers as fields
