# Field Codex 3.0 — Abstract for arXiv Preprint

Field Codex 3.0 introduces a cross-domain meta-framework that treats physical,
ecological, cognitive, artificial and socio-technical systems uniformly as
fields. A field is defined as a mapping Φ: 𝒳 × 𝒯 → 𝒮, enabling a unifying
spatiotemporal representation for systems traditionally studied in isolation.

The framework formalizes three core metrics:
- **Coherence (C)** — quantifying order and alignment
- **Interference (I)** — constructive or destructive interaction
- **Mutability (M)** — responsiveness under perturbation

Beyond defining metrics, the Codex develops new theoretical structures, including:
(1) a Field Renormalization Group (FRG) for tracking coherence across scales,
(2) a Field Causal Calculus (FCC) for interventions and counterfactual inference,
(3) a Coherence Thermodynamic formalism imposing energetic and entropic limits,
(4) a Field Computational Hierarchy distinguishing tractable and intractable
field problems, and (5) Adaptive Field Topology, where system geometry co-evolves
with field dynamics.

As an applied example, the Codex maps modern transformer-based AI architectures to
explicit field dynamics over token, layer and head coordinates, enabling direct
measurement of internal coherence, conceptual interference, and temporal stability.

Field Codex 3.0 provides a unified mathematical and operational language for
studying, comparing and steering coherence in systems across physics, ecology,
AI, cognition, and complex networks.
